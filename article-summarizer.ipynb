It’s not just the only way to make true espresso—it’s also one of the quickest ways to get a cup of good coffee in the morning. Most of our picks heat up in the time it takes a kettle to boil, and though dosing and tamping require a modicum of effort, it still takes only a minute or two between grinding your beans and sitting down with a hot, crema-topped espresso. We prioritized machines that can deliver delicious espresso shots without too much tinkering. Most novices could walk up to one of our picks and find their way around, but we think serious espresso drinkers would be happy with our picks too.

Sarah Kobos/NYT Wirecutter\n",
      "Home espresso machines can range from cheap and toylike to hulking machines costing thousands. Since 2016, we’ve tested models costing anywhere from $300 to $2,000, trying to find that sweet spot: machines that both novices and coffee obsessives could enjoy using, and that offer the best value—in build, features, and great-tasting coffee. At a baseline level, an espresso machine works by forcing hot water through finely ground coffee beans with pressure. Good ones heat the water to just the right temperature (about\n",
      "195 to 205 degrees Fahrenheit\n",
      ") and apply consistent pressure so that water flows through the grounds evenly, for a well-balanced extraction. Great ones are designed to ease transitions between various steps, and some offer luxe features to help the process. These machines keep pressure and temperature consistent but still allow you to adjust your grind size and coffee-to-water ratio and to froth your own milk; it’s a balance most skilled baristas prefer. Manual espresso machines, on the other hand, require you to create your own pressure by pulling on a lever. But they don’t offer much room for experimentation, and they’re often quite pricey. Our picks from smallest (left) to biggest (right): the Gaggia Classic Evo Go, the Profitec Go, the Breville Barista Touch, and the Breville Oracle Jet.\n",

      "PID (proportional integral derivative) controllers\n",
      ", which help regulate the boiler temperature, allowing for more consistent shots back to back. The Breville models we recommend also have ThermoJet heaters, so the machines heat up and transition between pulling a shot and steaming milk surprisingly quickly; some drink preparations took barely over a minute from start to finish. Powerful pump and steam wand:\n",
      "An espresso machine’s pump should be strong enough to properly extract espresso from a well-packed dose of finely ground coffee. And the steam wand should be powerful enough to produce a velvety milk foam free of any big bubbles. A good tamper should cover the width of the filter basket, and its handle should be comfortable to hold and easy to keep level. Machines that offer (effective) automatic milk frothing can be great for beginners who are still learning to steam milk—or anyone who doesn’t want to hold and angle a steam pitcher first thing in the morning. However, the exact nuances that distinguish good microfoam from excellent microfoam are ultimately better achieved manually. (There are great\n",

      "Many machines come with programmed settings, but beans can vary so much that we’ve found you’ll get better-tasting shots by starting and stopping your extraction manually (alongside some tweaking of your grind, dosing, and tamping). But once you’ve dialed in your favorite espresso, it’s nice to be able to save your shot volume and/or timing, to streamline your routine and keep it consistent. How we tested\n",
      "We took our time getting familiar with each machine. We steamed whole milk with both manual and automatic settings, using oat and almond milk when testing the non-dairy settings on the Brevilles. What we heard mattered, too: Steam wands that maintained a smooth sound rather than unpleasant sputtering had more power, frothed faster, and created better microfoam.

The portafilter also has a comfortable heft to it. The shots we pulled with the Profitec Go had a full wave of flavor, with some acid and depth. Our shots brought out the warm chocolate and nutty notes of the coffee we used; of course, the flavor profile will depend on the blend you use. Of all our picks, this machine allows you to control the most variables when pulling a shot. Like our Breville picks, the Profitec Go also has PID temperature control, which helps keep successive shots consistent. You can also adjust this machine’s pressure, so skilled hobbyists can really experiment with every parameter. (Though we think most people won’t need to fiddle with changing their machine’s pressure.) It heats up quickly. Though the Profitec Go doesn’t have the ThermoJet technology that our Breville picks have, it doesn’t take significantly longer to heat up. By the time you’ve ground your beans, prepped your puck, and filled up your milk jug, the machine will have reached brewing temperature.

      "The touchscreen is easy to use. The Barista Touch’s touchscreen is no gimmick—instead, it’s sophisticated, visually appealing, and easy to use. The digital menu walks you through the basics of making good espresso drinks, and it provides step-by-step troubleshooting, from grind to extraction to milk frothing. If you want more automation, there are factory presets for the classic espresso drinks (lattes, cappuccinos, and so on), but you can also program and save your own drink specifications, or use the machine manually. The shots we pulled on the Barista Touch were balanced, with decent depth. But it won’t produce the full body and complexity of flavors that you can achieve with a correct grind, dose, and tamp from a single-wall basket. We spent the bulk of testing using the traditional (single-wall) basket to make sure the Barista Touch could capture some of the nuance that can be lost with dual-wall filters (it could). The majority of shots pulled with the Touch emphasized a cocoa-y mid-tone, sometimes with a slight, pleasant tartness. Depending on the blend, some shots sang with a bit more citrus or even blackberry notes. But while still flavorful, the espresso from the Touch didn’t have the full complexity we could achieve with the Profitec Go and the Gaggia. The portafilter on the Breville Barista Touch is narrower and deeper than most portafilters. This makes it a bit harder to properly dial in and extract a shot, as the water has to push through a thicker bed of coffee, introducing more variability into each pull. It has great milk-frothing settings. The Touch has a powerful steam wand that is capable of making anything from super-dry milk froth to a smooth microfoam. Alternatively, you can choose to froth your milk manually, which works quite well, although you have less control over the wand’s placement than with our top pick. The steam wand also has a handy auto-purge feature, which helps keep it clean after you steam your milk.

We haven’t played around much with all the programs, but I love how easy it is to adjust all the settings with the touchscreen. It’s a barebones machine that prioritizes shots of espresso above all else, which makes it a great machine for budding coffee geeks to satisfy their palates without sacrificing their budget.

When making your first drink, the machine walks you through each step, with supplemental video clips showing you what to do. Of course, if you understand how to dial in a shot and what the extraction for your beans should look like, you may wish to disregard the machine’s guided dialing (which can be turned off in the settings) and use your own judgement. Unlike any of our other picks, the Oracle Jet does not allow you to set your own dose. By adjusting the tamp height, you could change the dose size, but it’s not an accurate method. Unlike with our top pick, you can’t adjust the pressure—which we don’t think is a feature most people need anyway. You are, however, still able to change the brewing temperature.

Like the Barista Touch and the Bambino Plus, the Oracle Jet has excellent automatic milk-frothing functions, with a range of textures and temperatures to choose from. And unlike the Barista Touch, the temperature gauge on the Oracle Jet is built into the tip of the steam wand, so you don’t have to balance the pitcher on top of a sensor. But it’s very pricey.

It’s not just the only way to make true espresso—it’s also one of the quickest ways to get a cup of good coffee in the morning. Most of our picks heat up in the time it takes a kettle to boil, and though dosing and tamping require a modicum of effort, it still takes only a minute or two between grinding your beans and sitting down with a hot, crema-topped espresso. We prioritized machines that can deliver delicious espresso shots without too much tinkering. Most novices could walk up to one of our picks and find their way around, but we think serious espresso drinkers would be happy with our picks too. For those who love café-style drinks like lattes, cappuccinos, or cortados, an espresso machine with\n",

Sarah Kobos/NYT Wirecutter\n",
      "Home espresso machines can range from cheap and toylike to hulking machines costing thousands. Since 2016, we’ve tested models costing anywhere from $300 to $2,000, trying to find that sweet spot: machines that both novices and coffee obsessives could enjoy using, and that offer the best value—in build, features, and great-tasting coffee. At a baseline level, an espresso machine works by forcing hot water through finely ground coffee beans with pressure. Good ones heat the water to just the right temperature (about\n",
      "195 to 205 degrees Fahrenheit\n",
      ") and apply consistent pressure so that water flows through the grounds evenly, for a well-balanced extraction. Great ones are designed to ease transitions between various steps, and some offer luxe features to help the process. These machines keep pressure and temperature consistent but still allow you to adjust your grind size and coffee-to-water ratio and to froth your own milk; it’s a balance most skilled baristas prefer. Manual espresso machines, on the other hand, require you to create your own pressure by pulling on a lever. But they don’t offer much room for experimentation, and they’re often quite pricey. Our picks from smallest (left) to biggest (right): the Gaggia Classic Evo Go, the Profitec Go, the Breville Barista Touch, and the Breville Oracle Jet.\n",

      "Single-boiler machines: But the technology has advanced enough that on most of our picks, there’s almost no wait between steps. Fast and consistent water heater: A speedy heater provides a fun, easy rhythm to what promises to be a daily ritual. To go a step further, some machines have\n",
      "PID (proportional integral derivative) controllers\n",
      ", which help regulate the boiler temperature, allowing for more consistent shots back to back. The Breville models we recommend also have ThermoJet heaters, so the machines heat up and transition between pulling a shot and steaming milk surprisingly quickly; some drink preparations took barely over a minute from start to finish. Powerful pump and steam wand:\n",
      "An espresso machine’s pump should be strong enough to properly extract espresso from a well-packed dose of finely ground coffee. And the steam wand should be powerful enough to produce a velvety milk foam free of any big bubbles. A good tamper should cover the width of the filter basket, and its handle should be comfortable to hold and easy to keep level. Machines that offer (effective) automatic milk frothing can be great for beginners who are still learning to steam milk—or anyone who doesn’t want to hold and angle a steam pitcher first thing in the morning. However, the exact nuances that distinguish good microfoam from excellent microfoam are ultimately better achieved manually. (There are great\n",
      "online video tutorials\n",
      "for that.) So although both of our Breville picks offer good automatic-frothing programs, we didn’t consider it a flaw that our other picks do not. Manual and programmable brewing options:\n",
      "Many machines come with programmed settings, but beans can vary so much that we’ve found you’ll get better-tasting shots by starting and stopping your extraction manually (alongside some tweaking of your grind, dosing, and tamping). But once you’ve dialed in your favorite espresso, it’s nice to be able to save your shot volume and/or timing, to streamline your routine and keep it consistent. How we tested\n",
      "We took our time getting familiar with each machine. We steamed whole milk with both manual and automatic settings, using oat and almond milk when testing the non-dairy settings on the Brevilles. What we heard mattered, too: Steam wands that maintained a smooth sound rather than unpleasant sputtering had more power, frothed faster, and created better microfoam.

There’s no need to brace the machine with one hand when locking the portafilter into the group head—it won’t budge (our budget pick, the Gaggia Classic Evo Pro, needs to be held still while locking in the portafilter). The portafilter also has a comfortable heft to it. The shots we pulled with the Profitec Go had a full wave of flavor, with some acid and depth. Our shots brought out the warm chocolate and nutty notes of the coffee we used; of course, the flavor profile will depend on the blend you use. Of all our picks, this machine allows you to control the most variables when pulling a shot. Like our Breville picks, the Profitec Go also has PID temperature control, which helps keep successive shots consistent. You can also adjust this machine’s pressure, so skilled hobbyists can really experiment with every parameter. (Though we think most people won’t need to fiddle with changing their machine’s pressure.) It heats up quickly. Though the Profitec Go doesn’t have the ThermoJet technology that our Breville picks have, it doesn’t take significantly longer to heat up. By the time you’ve ground your beans, prepped your puck, and filled up your milk jug, the machine will have reached brewing temperature. The machine will remain ready to brew until you turn it off, but you can also set a timer with its Eco mode to shut it off after a certain period of time. Flaws but not dealbreakers\n",

And if you don’t need the guidance, you’ll still appreciate this machine’s powerful steam wand and consistent shots, as well as the ability to refine your results with the help of on-screen timers and custom settings. The Barista Touch’s touchscreen is easy to use, and it displays timers for grinding and brewing to help you refine your shot. Sarah Kobos/NYT Wirecutter\n",
      "The touchscreen is easy to use. The Barista Touch’s touchscreen is no gimmick—instead, it’s sophisticated, visually appealing, and easy to use. The digital menu walks you through the basics of making good espresso drinks, and it provides step-by-step troubleshooting, from grind to extraction to milk frothing. If you want more automation, there are factory presets for the classic espresso drinks (lattes, cappuccinos, and so on), but you can also program and save your own drink specifications, or use the machine manually. The shots we pulled on the Barista Touch were balanced, with decent depth. But it won’t produce the full body and complexity of flavors that you can achieve with a correct grind, dose, and tamp from a single-wall basket. We spent the bulk of testing using the traditional (single-wall) basket to make sure the Barista Touch could capture some of the nuance that can be lost with dual-wall filters (it could). The majority of shots pulled with the Touch emphasized a cocoa-y mid-tone, sometimes with a slight, pleasant tartness. Depending on the blend, some shots sang with a bit more citrus or even blackberry notes. But while still flavorful, the espresso from the Touch didn’t have the full complexity we could achieve with the Profitec Go and the Gaggia. The portafilter on the Breville Barista Touch is narrower and deeper than most portafilters. This makes it a bit harder to properly dial in and extract a shot, as the water has to push through a thicker bed of coffee, introducing more variability into each pull. It has great milk-frothing settings. The Touch has a powerful steam wand that is capable of making anything from super-dry milk froth to a smooth microfoam. Alternatively, you can choose to froth your milk manually, which works quite well, although you have less control over the wand’s placement than with our top pick. The steam wand also has a handy auto-purge feature, which helps keep it clean after you steam your milk. The temperature scale gives you the option to steam cooler cortados, toddler-friendly hot chocolates, or extra-hot lattes. tab pops up when the drip tray is full. Photo: Sarah Kobos\n",

But the grinder can’t make the fine adjustments that the grinder on the Oracle Jet can, so the jump between each grind size is pretty large. We haven’t played around much with all the programs, but I love how easy it is to adjust all the settings with the touchscreen. It’s a barebones machine that prioritizes shots of espresso above all else, which makes it a great machine for budding coffee geeks to satisfy their palates without sacrificing their budget. We sampled shots that brought forth notes of dark chocolate and bright citrus from the beans, and they had the same wave of flavor as the shots that the Profitec Go produced.

Of course, you’ll likely have better results after giving the machine more time to warm up, but you can get a good espresso immediately if you need it. Like most non-Breville machines, the Gaggia doesn’t come with a steam pitcher. Inserting the removable water tank under the boiler while making sure both rubber tubes are in place is tricky.

During setup, the large screen displays an interactive diagram of the machine, which allows you to learn what each part does and how to use it, effectively teaching you the basics of an espresso machine. When making your first drink, the machine walks you through each step, with supplemental video clips showing you what to do. Of course, if you understand how to dial in a shot and what the extraction for your beans should look like, you may wish to disregard the machine’s guided dialing (which can be turned off in the settings) and use your own judgement. Unlike any of our other picks, the Oracle Jet does not allow you to set your own dose. By adjusting the tamp height, you could change the dose size, but it’s not an accurate method. Unlike with our top pick, you can’t adjust the pressure—which we don’t think is a feature most people need anyway. You are, however, still able to change the brewing temperature. Tamping evenly can be a pain for new espresso drinkers (and causes literal wrist pain for seasoned baristas).

If you prefer cooler drinks or need some cooled-down espresso for cooking or baking, it can be a handy feature. The cold-brew setting was less impressive. Like the Barista Touch and the Bambino Plus, the Oracle Jet has excellent automatic milk-frothing functions, with a range of textures and temperatures to choose from. And unlike the Barista Touch, the temperature gauge on the Oracle Jet is built into the tip of the steam wand, so you don’t have to balance the pitcher on top of a sensor. But it’s very pricey.

It’s not just the only way to make true espresso—it’s also one of the quickest ways to get a cup of good coffee in the morning. Most of our picks heat up in the time it takes a kettle to boil, and though dosing and tamping require a modicum of effort, it still takes only a minute or two between grinding your beans and sitting down with a hot, crema-topped espresso. We prioritized machines that can deliver delicious espresso shots without too much tinkering. Most novices could walk up to one of our picks and find their way around, but we think serious espresso drinkers would be happy with our picks too.

Sarah Kobos/NYT Wirecutter\n",
      "Home espresso machines can range from cheap and toylike to hulking machines costing thousands. Since 2016, we’ve tested models costing anywhere from $300 to $2,000, trying to find that sweet spot: machines that both novices and coffee obsessives could enjoy using, and that offer the best value—in build, features, and great-tasting coffee. At a baseline level, an espresso machine works by forcing hot water through finely ground coffee beans with pressure. Good ones heat the water to just the right temperature (about\n",
      "195 to 205 degrees Fahrenheit\n",
      ") and apply consistent pressure so that water flows through the grounds evenly, for a well-balanced extraction. Great ones are designed to ease transitions between various steps, and some offer luxe features to help the process. These machines keep pressure and temperature consistent but still allow you to adjust your grind size and coffee-to-water ratio and to froth your own milk; it’s a balance most skilled baristas prefer. Manual espresso machines, on the other hand, require you to create your own pressure by pulling on a lever. But they don’t offer much room for experimentation, and they’re often quite pricey. Our picks from smallest (left) to biggest (right): the Gaggia Classic Evo Go, the Profitec Go, the Breville Barista Touch, and the Breville Oracle Jet.\n",

      "Single-boiler machines: But the technology has advanced enough that on most of our picks, there’s almost no wait between steps. Fast and consistent water heater: A speedy heater provides a fun, easy rhythm to what promises to be a daily ritual. To go a step further, some machines have\n",
      "PID (proportional integral derivative) controllers\n",
      ", which help regulate the boiler temperature, allowing for more consistent shots back to back. The Breville models we recommend also have ThermoJet heaters, so the machines heat up and transition between pulling a shot and steaming milk surprisingly quickly; some drink preparations took barely over a minute from start to finish. Powerful pump and steam wand:\n",
      "An espresso machine’s pump should be strong enough to properly extract espresso from a well-packed dose of finely ground coffee. And the steam wand should be powerful enough to produce a velvety milk foam free of any big bubbles. A good tamper should cover the width of the filter basket, and its handle should be comfortable to hold and easy to keep level. Machines that offer (effective) automatic milk frothing can be great for beginners who are still learning to steam milk—or anyone who doesn’t want to hold and angle a steam pitcher first thing in the morning. However, the exact nuances that distinguish good microfoam from excellent microfoam are ultimately better achieved manually. (There are great\n",
      "online video tutorials\n",
      "for that.) So although both of our Breville picks offer good automatic-frothing programs, we didn’t consider it a flaw that our other picks do not. Manual and programmable brewing options:\n",
      "Many machines come with programmed settings, but beans can vary so much that we’ve found you’ll get better-tasting shots by starting and stopping your extraction manually (alongside some tweaking of your grind, dosing, and tamping). But once you’ve dialed in your favorite espresso, it’s nice to be able to save your shot volume and/or timing, to streamline your routine and keep it consistent. How we tested\n",
      "We took our time getting familiar with each machine. We steamed whole milk with both manual and automatic settings, using oat and almond milk when testing the non-dairy settings on the Brevilles. What we heard mattered, too: Steam wands that maintained a smooth sound rather than unpleasant sputtering had more power, frothed faster, and created better microfoam.

There’s no need to brace the machine with one hand when locking the portafilter into the group head—it won’t budge (our budget pick, the Gaggia Classic Evo Pro, needs to be held still while locking in the portafilter). The portafilter also has a comfortable heft to it. The shots we pulled with the Profitec Go had a full wave of flavor, with some acid and depth. Our shots brought out the warm chocolate and nutty notes of the coffee we used; of course, the flavor profile will depend on the blend you use. Of all our picks, this machine allows you to control the most variables when pulling a shot. Like our Breville picks, the Profitec Go also has PID temperature control, which helps keep successive shots consistent. You can also adjust this machine’s pressure, so skilled hobbyists can really experiment with every parameter. (Though we think most people won’t need to fiddle with changing their machine’s pressure.) It heats up quickly. Though the Profitec Go doesn’t have the ThermoJet technology that our Breville picks have, it doesn’t take significantly longer to heat up. By the time you’ve ground your beans, prepped your puck, and filled up your milk jug, the machine will have reached brewing temperature. The machine will remain ready to brew until you turn it off, but you can also set a timer with its Eco mode to shut it off after a certain period of time. Flaws but not dealbreakers\n",

      "The touchscreen is easy to use. The Barista Touch’s touchscreen is no gimmick—instead, it’s sophisticated, visually appealing, and easy to use. The digital menu walks you through the basics of making good espresso drinks, and it provides step-by-step troubleshooting, from grind to extraction to milk frothing. If you want more automation, there are factory presets for the classic espresso drinks (lattes, cappuccinos, and so on), but you can also program and save your own drink specifications, or use the machine manually. The shots we pulled on the Barista Touch were balanced, with decent depth. But it won’t produce the full body and complexity of flavors that you can achieve with a correct grind, dose, and tamp from a single-wall basket. We spent the bulk of testing using the traditional (single-wall) basket to make sure the Barista Touch could capture some of the nuance that can be lost with dual-wall filters (it could). The majority of shots pulled with the Touch emphasized a cocoa-y mid-tone, sometimes with a slight, pleasant tartness. Depending on the blend, some shots sang with a bit more citrus or even blackberry notes. But while still flavorful, the espresso from the Touch didn’t have the full complexity we could achieve with the Profitec Go and the Gaggia. The portafilter on the Breville Barista Touch is narrower and deeper than most portafilters. This makes it a bit harder to properly dial in and extract a shot, as the water has to push through a thicker bed of coffee, introducing more variability into each pull. It has great milk-frothing settings. The Touch has a powerful steam wand that is capable of making anything from super-dry milk froth to a smooth microfoam. Alternatively, you can choose to froth your milk manually, which works quite well, although you have less control over the wand’s placement than with our top pick. The steam wand also has a handy auto-purge feature, which helps keep it clean after you steam your milk. The temperature scale gives you the option to steam cooler cortados, toddler-friendly hot chocolates, or extra-hot lattes. tab pops up when the drip tray is full. Photo: Sarah Kobos\n",

We haven’t played around much with all the programs, but I love how easy it is to adjust all the settings with the touchscreen. It’s a barebones machine that prioritizes shots of espresso above all else, which makes it a great machine for budding coffee geeks to satisfy their palates without sacrificing their budget.

      ", with a better grinder, more guidance, a more-effective portafilter shape, and a slightly better steam-wand design, plus an automatic tamper. During setup, the large screen displays an interactive diagram of the machine, which allows you to learn what each part does and how to use it, effectively teaching you the basics of an espresso machine. When making your first drink, the machine walks you through each step, with supplemental video clips showing you what to do. Of course, if you understand how to dial in a shot and what the extraction for your beans should look like, you may wish to disregard the machine’s guided dialing (which can be turned off in the settings) and use your own judgement. Unlike any of our other picks, the Oracle Jet does not allow you to set your own dose. By adjusting the tamp height, you could change the dose size, but it’s not an accurate method. Unlike with our top pick, you can’t adjust the pressure—which we don’t think is a feature most people need anyway. You are, however, still able to change the brewing temperature. Tamping evenly can be a pain for new espresso drinkers (and causes literal wrist pain for seasoned baristas). It’s like a magic trick—in goes an empty filter basket, and out comes a smooth, level espresso puck. Connie Park/NYT Wirecutter\n",

      ". The knock box is a nice inclusion and makes the cleanup process quick and easy. It took only about 20 seconds longer to brew, and the espresso came out noticeably cool (though not cold). If you prefer cooler drinks or need some cooled-down espresso for cooking or baking, it can be a handy feature. The cold-brew setting was less impressive. Like the Barista Touch and the Bambino Plus, the Oracle Jet has excellent automatic milk-frothing functions, with a range of textures and temperatures to choose from. And unlike the Barista Touch, the temperature gauge on the Oracle Jet is built into the tip of the steam wand, so you don’t have to balance the pitcher on top of a sensor. But it’s very pricey. But you won’t feel cheated with the Oracle Jet—the entire experience is smooth and utterly undemanding. Advertisement\n",

      "Home espresso machines can range from cheap and toylike to hulking machines costing thousands. Since 2016, we’ve tested models costing anywhere from $300 to $2,000, trying to find that sweet spot: machines that both novices and coffee obsessives could enjoy using, and that offer the best value—in build, features, and great-tasting coffee. At a baseline level, an espresso machine works by forcing hot water through finely ground coffee beans with pressure. Good ones heat the water to just the right temperature (about\n",
      "195 to 205 degrees Fahrenheit\n",
      ") and apply consistent pressure so that water flows through the grounds evenly, for a well-balanced extraction. Great ones are designed to ease transitions between various steps, and some offer luxe features to help the process. These machines keep pressure and temperature consistent but still allow you to adjust your grind size and coffee-to-water ratio and to froth your own milk; it’s a balance most skilled baristas prefer. Manual espresso machines, on the other hand, require you to create your own pressure by pulling on a lever. But they don’t offer much room for experimentation, and they’re often quite pricey. Our picks from smallest (left) to biggest (right): the Gaggia Classic Evo Go, the Profitec Go, the Breville Barista Touch, and the Breville Oracle Jet.\n",

      "PID (proportional integral derivative) controllers\n",
      ", which help regulate the boiler temperature, allowing for more consistent shots back to back. The Breville models we recommend also have ThermoJet heaters, so the machines heat up and transition between pulling a shot and steaming milk surprisingly quickly; some drink preparations took barely over a minute from start to finish. Powerful pump and steam wand:\n",
      "An espresso machine’s pump should be strong enough to properly extract espresso from a well-packed dose of finely ground coffee. And the steam wand should be powerful enough to produce a velvety milk foam free of any big bubbles. A good tamper should cover the width of the filter basket, and its handle should be comfortable to hold and easy to keep level. Machines that offer (effective) automatic milk frothing can be great for beginners who are still learning to steam milk—or anyone who doesn’t want to hold and angle a steam pitcher first thing in the morning. However, the exact nuances that distinguish good microfoam from excellent microfoam are ultimately better achieved manually. (There are great\n",

      "Many machines come with programmed settings, but beans can vary so much that we’ve found you’ll get better-tasting shots by starting and stopping your extraction manually (alongside some tweaking of your grind, dosing, and tamping). But once you’ve dialed in your favorite espresso, it’s nice to be able to save your shot volume and/or timing, to streamline your routine and keep it consistent. How we tested\n",
      "We took our time getting familiar with each machine. We steamed whole milk with both manual and automatic settings, using oat and almond milk when testing the non-dairy settings on the Brevilles. What we heard mattered, too: Steam wands that maintained a smooth sound rather than unpleasant sputtering had more power, frothed faster, and created better microfoam.

There’s no need to brace the machine with one hand when locking the portafilter into the group head—it won’t budge (our budget pick, the Gaggia Classic Evo Pro, needs to be held still while locking in the portafilter). The portafilter also has a comfortable heft to it. The shots we pulled with the Profitec Go had a full wave of flavor, with some acid and depth. Our shots brought out the warm chocolate and nutty notes of the coffee we used; of course, the flavor profile will depend on the blend you use. Of all our picks, this machine allows you to control the most variables when pulling a shot. Like our Breville picks, the Profitec Go also has PID temperature control, which helps keep successive shots consistent. You can also adjust this machine’s pressure, so skilled hobbyists can really experiment with every parameter. (Though we think most people won’t need to fiddle with changing their machine’s pressure.) It heats up quickly. Though the Profitec Go doesn’t have the ThermoJet technology that our Breville picks have, it doesn’t take significantly longer to heat up. By the time you’ve ground your beans, prepped your puck, and filled up your milk jug, the machine will have reached brewing temperature. The machine will remain ready to brew until you turn it off, but you can also set a timer with its Eco mode to shut it off after a certain period of time. Flaws but not dealbreakers\n",

The Barista Touch’s touchscreen is easy to use, and it displays timers for grinding and brewing to help you refine your shot. Sarah Kobos/NYT Wirecutter\n",
      "The touchscreen is easy to use. The Barista Touch’s touchscreen is no gimmick—instead, it’s sophisticated, visually appealing, and easy to use. The digital menu walks you through the basics of making good espresso drinks, and it provides step-by-step troubleshooting, from grind to extraction to milk frothing. If you want more automation, there are factory presets for the classic espresso drinks (lattes, cappuccinos, and so on), but you can also program and save your own drink specifications, or use the machine manually. The shots we pulled on the Barista Touch were balanced, with decent depth. But it won’t produce the full body and complexity of flavors that you can achieve with a correct grind, dose, and tamp from a single-wall basket. We spent the bulk of testing using the traditional (single-wall) basket to make sure the Barista Touch could capture some of the nuance that can be lost with dual-wall filters (it could). The majority of shots pulled with the Touch emphasized a cocoa-y mid-tone, sometimes with a slight, pleasant tartness. Depending on the blend, some shots sang with a bit more citrus or even blackberry notes. But while still flavorful, the espresso from the Touch didn’t have the full complexity we could achieve with the Profitec Go and the Gaggia. The portafilter on the Breville Barista Touch is narrower and deeper than most portafilters. This makes it a bit harder to properly dial in and extract a shot, as the water has to push through a thicker bed of coffee, introducing more variability into each pull. It has great milk-frothing settings. The Touch has a powerful steam wand that is capable of making anything from super-dry milk froth to a smooth microfoam. Alternatively, you can choose to froth your milk manually, which works quite well, although you have less control over the wand’s placement than with our top pick. The steam wand also has a handy auto-purge feature, which helps keep it clean after you steam your milk. The temperature scale gives you the option to steam cooler cortados, toddler-friendly hot chocolates, or extra-hot lattes. tab pops up when the drip tray is full. Photo: Sarah Kobos\n",

But the grinder can’t make the fine adjustments that the grinder on the Oracle Jet can, so the jump between each grind size is pretty large. We haven’t played around much with all the programs, but I love how easy it is to adjust all the settings with the touchscreen. It’s a barebones machine that prioritizes shots of espresso above all else, which makes it a great machine for budding coffee geeks to satisfy their palates without sacrificing their budget.

When making your first drink, the machine walks you through each step, with supplemental video clips showing you what to do. Of course, if you understand how to dial in a shot and what the extraction for your beans should look like, you may wish to disregard the machine’s guided dialing (which can be turned off in the settings) and use your own judgement. Unlike any of our other picks, the Oracle Jet does not allow you to set your own dose. By adjusting the tamp height, you could change the dose size, but it’s not an accurate method. Unlike with our top pick, you can’t adjust the pressure—which we don’t think is a feature most people need anyway. You are, however, still able to change the brewing temperature.

If you prefer cooler drinks or need some cooled-down espresso for cooking or baking, it can be a handy feature. The cold-brew setting was less impressive. Like the Barista Touch and the Bambino Plus, the Oracle Jet has excellent automatic milk-frothing functions, with a range of textures and temperatures to choose from. And unlike the Barista Touch, the temperature gauge on the Oracle Jet is built into the tip of the steam wand, so you don’t have to balance the pitcher on top of a sensor. But it’s very pricey.
