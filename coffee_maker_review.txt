Making café-quality espresso drinks at home is no longer reserved for coffee hobbyists and former baristas. New home espresso machines have made it easier than ever for a beginner to get started. With just a little practice, you can have lattes and cortados that rival those from an upscale café—all without changing out of your pajamas.
After testing dozens of machines, we think the
Profitec Go
is the best option for new and skilled enthusiasts alike. It’s powerful and easy to use, and it’s capable of yielding consistent, rich shots with robust flavor profiles.

Gaggia Classic Pro
Nuanced espresso for an entry-level price
This affordable machine can yield surprisingly complex shots, though you’ll need to buy a separate tamper to get there. Frothing milk can be a bit tricky, but microfoam is manageable.

The
Profitec Go
is a heavy, sleek, and impressive machine. It pulls shots with a full range of flavor and depth, and it can be dialed in to highlight particular characteristics of your beans. It’s straightforward, with a basic (though attractive) design, a comfortable portafilter that locks into the group head easily, and a steam wand that can be angled to a wide range of heights and directions.
The steam wand isn’t especially powerful, but it takes only a little practice before you’re making beautiful, silky foam. This is a great machine for anyone seriously interested in the espresso-making process, but it’ll serve a novice well, too.

The
Breville Barista Touch
is great for beginners, as it offers lots of guidance in the form of a touchscreen control center with step-by-step tutorials and multiple programs. It also includes advanced controls and allows for manual operation, for more-experienced users and people who want to get creative.
It has a good built-in grinder, as well as an adjustable auto-froth setting for milk that lets you control the amount of foam created. It’s a great choice for those who want to dive right in and start making decent drinks without too much practice but still want the option of a more hands-on espresso experience.

The
Gaggia Classic Evo Pro
is the updated version of the Gaggia Classic, which has been a popular entry-level machine for decades, thanks to its simple, approachable design and ability to produce barista-worthy espresso shots. While the Classic Evo Pro has a somewhat improved steam wand compared with the Classic’s, it’s still on the weaker side. It’s capable of creating milk froth with a velvety texture, but it takes time and practice.
The Pro isn’t quite as easy for beginners to master as our Breville picks, but it was able to produce shots with greater nuance. If you have a taste for high-quality espresso but little budget to spare, the Gaggia will serve you well. However, we strongly recommend buying a
quality tamper
to replace the flimsy plastic one that comes with the machine.

The
Breville Oracle Jet
does most of the work for you—but unlike super-automatic machines, it also teaches you to be a better barista, walking you through the steps and even detecting the small changes required to dial in a good shot.
Like the Barista Touch, it has a touchscreen control center that takes you step by step through the process, as well as multiple drink programs to choose from. But it has a better built-in grinder, an automatic tamper, and an updated automated milk wand with non-dairy milk-frothing options. Even a houseguest could easily walk up, use this machine, and end up with a pretty great drink.
